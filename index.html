                This is the first open-world sonic game.This game actually came out before
                GTA III, so this could be the first open-world game. This particular
                open-world game was very new and a head of the time and sonic was actually very popular.
                To be able to travel across the sonic world and do missions was a dream
                for a young me.

                This was another open world game ahead of its time. I just remember walking
                the streets of Yokosuka, walking door to door knocking in hopes to find any
                clues to find my father's murderer. Although I didn't enjoy some of the
                quick-time events, the adventure was unforgettable. This was the first
                time I completely felt immersed in a video game.

              Oooh, the endless combos. This game I only rented but I had it for sooo
              long we had a huge fee to pay to blockbuster. I played this game over and
              over and over and over. It felt like each time I played it I saw something
              new. I always wanted to know what it would be like to be Neo in a video game
              and this game did a great job depicting it.

         <p>
             Ok, Powerstone was Super Smash Brothers before Super Smash Brothers. It is
             possible that this series inspired Super Smash or that they inspired each
             other. This was plenty of fun alone and with friends. I could never forget
             re-playing the demo countless times.

        <p>
            Fable was like no other game I played. It was short but the replay value was
            high. At that time, I always thought the longer the game is, the more impressive.
            This game taught me that there is beauty is a short story.<br><br> The level
            of detail &amp; possibilities in this game was incredible. You could get
            married, grow old, be evil, and get scarrs in battles. I found a new appreciation
            for detail in video games thanks to this game.

            I just remember waking up one Christmas and unwraping this game. The rest
            is pretty much history. I loved games that manipulated time but this
            game somehow appeared to do it differently. Rewind your death and try
            to get it right the second time or use slow motion to land a far jump.
            I appreciated the cerebral aspect of the game.

       <p>
           I have fond memories of playing this game. I just remember
           playing for hours. Exploring the vast worlds and fighting armor clad
           reptiles. I think this might be one of the games fans couldn't stand
           because it wasn't normal Starfox but honestly, I wouldn't play a normal Starfox game.
           I did appreciate this new spin on the series.

            This game still holds up today. There are many awesome Mario adventures
            but for some reason this is the only mario game I was able to complete.
            I enjoyed using all of the different water powered gadgets given to me.
            Somehow this game managed to make cleaning fun. If that isn't amazing
            I don't know what is.

           <p>
               This is the only game I've played at the time that truly simulated real
               life. You could make the character eat, drink, workout, and all of these
               had an effect on your character. If you ate too much you could look just
               like the third photo. I couldn't believe the features in the game.

            The game of complete <b>FREEDOM</b>! I love a game when everytime you
            play it something completely different can happen. You could even betray
            your own team if you wanted. I put this game at number one because it
            still holds up after all these years. The story was great, the combat
            was fulfilling, and most of all the freedom to choose every thing in
            the game. This game had no hand holding. There aren't many games like
            these anymore and for that reason it will always be in my heart.
